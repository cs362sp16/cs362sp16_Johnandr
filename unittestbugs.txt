Unit testing for Cards

	Testing for Outpost:
		It seems like the outpost function works great in cardEffect.
		CardEffect works proper when using this card!

	Testing for Salvager:
		It seems like the adding coins and adding buys isn't working properly.
		For adding coins, I believe the reason is from getCost function.
		CardEffect works properly when using this card!

	Testing for Steward:
		It looks like steward is working perfectly with cardEffect.
		Got to check multiple choice 1 options. Worked for both options. 
		Mostly checked with the coins option worked properly.
		CardEffect works properly when using this card!

	Testing for Baron:
		It seems like the baron function works great in cardEffect.
		Tested the option of choice1 = 0 and 1 to test both parts 
		of the card multiple times.
