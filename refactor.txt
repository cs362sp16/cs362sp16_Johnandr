PROGRAMMER : 	ANDREW JOHNSON
UPDATE NOTES:	ASSIGNMENT 1

Change 1: REFACTORED ADVENTURER CARD

	I took all code associated with adventurer and placed it
	in a function called adventurer_Card, and sent in neccesary
	inputs for the function to work properly. 
	Saw cardDrawn was only used for adventurer so I commented
	it out in cardEffect and initalized it in adventuer_Card.

Change 2: REFACTORED BARON CARD

	I took all of baron's code and place in the function called
	baron_Card. Only needed to send in choice1, state, and currentPlayer.
	Nothing else majorly important.

Change 3: REFACTORED TRIBUTE CARD

	Moved all of tribute's code int function called tribute_Card.
	Also moved tributeRevealedCards into the function, since 
	tribute is the only function using the variable. 
	Had to initialize i in the function as well for the for loops

Change 4: REFACTORED AMBASSADOR CARD

	Moved all code of ambassador in switch statement to 
	function ambassdor_Card. Had to initialize i and j for
	the function.

Change 5: REFACTORED FEAST CARD

	Moved all code of feast from switch statement to the
	function feast_Card. Had to initialize i, and decided
	to move x from cardEffect to feast_Card since feast
	is the only card using x.
